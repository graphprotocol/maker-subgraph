####################Debt Market#########################

# Tap - aka Debt Market. The tap is a liquidator
# System surplus accumulates as excess DAI, which are sold in exchange for collateral (PETH) via BOOM
# Seized Collateral from Forced Liquidations (PETH) is also sent to the tap where it is sold for DAI via bust
# the tap tries to minimize its tokens balances - DAI and SIN can be bought on market to cancel each other out.
# Tap can BOOM - sell Dai in returh for PETH (decrease joy, woe, PETH)
# Tap can BUST - sell PETH in return for DAI (decreases fog, increases joy, woe, possibly PETH)

    id: ID!
    joy: BigInt!              # DAI balance. Surplus transferred from DRIP

    s2s: BigInt!              # Derived price, the price of PETH in DAI
